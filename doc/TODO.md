------------------------------------- Done ------------------------------------------
+ implement resource set
+ extract SIA from certificates
+ do validation concurrently 

+ register new publication points while validating

+ "updateStatuses" in the bootstrap is wrong
+ add "I'm going to take care of this new repo" set to the top-down context

+ fix flaky behavior of the top-down
+ Count validated objects, compare with the others
+ Save VRPs somewhere, compare with the others (the same as routinator)
+ Fix "thread blocked indefinitely in an STM transaction"
+ Serialise VRPs incrementally in a separate thread.
+ Save validation errors/warnings while traversing the tree
+ Calculated hashed from the raw input, compare first and only then parse further (NO)
+ Fix MDB_BAD_VALSIZE, but first associate VRs with a timestamp
+ Fix broken tree traversal (Word32 -> Int32 was a bad idea)
+ Add timing of the main building blocks
+ Make WorldVersion more precise, update it only periodically and at proper moments
+ Add version storage and connect versions with VRPs and other stuff
+ Have a cache directory (.rpki-data (tals, lmsb, rsync, tmp))
+ Download TA cert by HTTPS 
+ Fix RRDP so that it uses deltas properly
+ Add tests for repository storage
+ Fix txConsumeFold for forM :: ExceptT a ... -> 
+ Delta processing can result in much bigger heap than snaphiost processing? fix it if that's the case.
+ add 'bootlneck' implementation as 'minimum of two bottlnecks at any moment'
+ Refactor the parallel two-thread stuff to use streaming
+ Relationship between ExceptT, forM and channles -- it's all can be done better only with exceptions.
+ RRDP transaction must roll back in case of an error
+ Save validation results from the top-level functions such as bootstrapTA and validateTA
+ Only complateWorldVersion when _all_ TAs have completed it
+ Do not make TA cert update a separate stage
+ Clean up objects that are not touched by validations or not touched by repository downloads
+ Cleanup VRPs and validation results as well based on their world version.
+ Add periodic re-validation
+ Do not save objects as one big transaction, it's not going to be a problem to save smaller chunks of objects, but will not lock the whole DB for seconds.
+ Have full path from the top repoistory to all the delegates ones in the VContext.
+ Do no allow to withdraw objects with "<withdraw .. />" if they belong to another repository (or ignore withdraws entirely, as for rsync) -- ignore 'withdraw' completely
+ Detect loops in the repository structure and AKI/SKI references.
+ Fix encoding in CSV
+ Filter object names in RRDP (to prevent error coming from TAL file in the RRDP snapshot of AfriNIC)
+ it looks like validCount number is flaky and changes depending on (check it)
+ Fix lost VRPs
+ Database stats
+ Introduce artifical time-ordered keys for RpkiObjectStore, so that we avoid fragmentation. 
  Having hashes as keys makes objects being added to and deleted from completely random places
  of the map and introduces a lot of fragmentation.
+ Exception processing for RRDP.Update as for Rsync
+ Timeouts for repository fetching 
+ Call newManager for HTTP only once, it's very expensive+
+ Read config and CLI options
+ Set timeouts on repository downloads and interrupt downloads that are too long.
+ Store verified resource set in the waiting list for an overclaiming certificate, to recover the process properly.
+ Implement "object browser"
+ add 'race (try $ wait) (atomically $ unless (isEmpty queue) retry)' to the submitTask (???)
+ Introduce "fetch failure tolerance period" within which we are okay to use object from the cache in case repository fetching failed.
  It is not a monoid, so keep this RpkiUrl -> LastSuccessuflFetch as separate map. Use some 'merge' intead of '<>' to PublicationPoints.
+ Check manifest SIA == manifest location
+ Fix 'Fetching repository https://rpki.cnnic.cn/rrdp/notify.xml failed: RrdpE (CantDownloadSnapshot "/Users/mpuzanov/.rpki/tmp: openTempFile: resource exhausted (Too many open files)")'
+ Fix ARIN broken CRL 
+ Fix Warnings "No object #{uri} with hash #{oldHash} to replace." or ignore it. 
+ Connect objects to repositories and implement a strict delta->snapshot fallback
+ Introduce shared state for "the latest discovered bunch of VRPs" to be used in 
  * RTR responses to reset queuries and diffs
  * /api/vrps.* responses
  OR figure out an option to get the from LMDB with less CPU/allocations
+ Fix 'cpu-count' defaulting to 1 and default it to 'all CPUs present in the system'.
+ Limit 'notify PDU' to once a minute.
+ RTR keepalive should have a time interval (it's a system-wide setting)
+ Implement RTR server.
 * Store only as much VRPs in diff as in one full VRP set, avoid potential bloating
 * Limit total amoutn of VRPs in rtr diffs
 * generation seesion based on current time or so (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8210#section-5.1)
 * Fix (if broken) sent Error PDUs
+ Optimise rsync/snapshot loading: check for hash presence _before_ parsing it.
+ ".cer", ".mft", ... must be compared case-insensitively to decide of the object type.

---------------------------------  In testing -----------------------------------------

- Do LMDb cache de-fragmentation
- Implement `--reset`
- Check cRLDistributionPoints == CRL location on the MFT
- Resource manipulation, tests coverage.

---------------------------------  In progress ----------------------------------------

 - Gather stats on how much objects are updated/deleted in delta/snapshot updates to make better 
  choices when to download one or another.
   * validation stats   

 - Some repositories are shared between multiple TAs, make sure they are not updated multiple times.
 (share topdowncontext)

--------------------------------------- TODOs -----------------------------------------


- FIX:
 Segmentation fault in liblmdb!



- Implement the latest 8210bis whatever the hell it becomes (strict MFTs, 'failed fetch' concept).
- Implement MFT filename check

- Implement RRDP -> rsync fall-back.
- make sure that manifest entries only contain characters that belong to "DER printable string"
- Implement `--reset`, i.e. erase cache/tmp/rsync on the start (keep some metadata, i.e. "version" of the DB and refuse to work with an older incompatible version?)

- Implement SLURM support (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8416) 
   * store a json file? it's not very effient in case of AS0 in SLURM, so think about something more scalable, binary serialisation, etc.
   * in any case SLURM data must not be stored in LMDB so that it would be possible to erase the cache. 

- Refactor RPKI.Repository and RPKI.Store.Repository to be more ergonomic and easy to understand.

- Relate objects to the repositories they are downloaded from and clean up them before saving snapshots


- Check signature algorithms (
    http://sobornost.net/~job/arin-manifest-issue-2020.08.12.txt,
    https://www.arin.net/announcements/20200812/)
  This needs modifying hs-certificate or implementing another custom parser for signature algorithm.  

- ???? Figure out how to classify "successful" validation and unsuccessful one to update the VRPs

- Implement UI

- Fix 'ctrl+c', it should stop the applications

- ???? Figure out how to classify "successful" validation and unsuccessful one to update the VRPs

- Lock the ".rpki" directory (or whatever is used instead) to avoid multiple copies of the same thing?

- Keep in LMDB only the necessary part of an object after checking it's signature.
- Review the validation and check if everything is according to the RFCs (time, digests, etc.)

- replace `streaming-utils` and `json-stream` with something more alive.
- use co-log-concurrent (https://gist.github.com/qnikst/f38bbaee033aaa3df8a9d115c951182a)
- refactor roTx/rwTx machinery so that rwTx accept both RO/RW handlers
