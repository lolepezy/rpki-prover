# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

RPKI Prover is an implementation of [RPKI relying party software](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rpki/using-rpki-data.html) focused on achieving a reasonable balance between resource utilization and ease of maintenance. This implementation aims to address potential security vulnerabilities by utilizing process isolation,
memory and time constraints, and other techniques to prevent resource exhaustion attacks and ensure
that it "keeps going," even when encountering unstable or maliciously constructed RPKI repositories.

Issues are tracked [here](https://github.com/lolepezy/rpki-prover/issues). You can also ask questions there.

# Installation and usage <a name="usage"></a>

Running `rpki-prover --help` displays a description of CLI options.

The only dependency required for `rpki-prover` is an `rsync` client.

`rpki-prover` is a daemon that periodically revalidates all TAs in the RPKI hierarchy. The results are exposed via the UI, JSON API, and Prometheus metrics. The `--with-rtr` option enables the RTR server, which pushes VRP updates to RTR clients.

There is no configuration file; all configuration is provided via the CLI. Most defaults are reasonable, so you typically don't need to adjust many parameters. A typical command line might look like this:

```
/opt/bin/rpki-prover --rpki-root-directory /var/rpki/ --cpu-count 4 --http-api-port 8080
```

At the first launch, `rpki-prover` initializes the filesystem layout and
downloads [TAL files](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/ripe-ncc-rpki-trust-anchor-structure/).

## Static Linux binary <a name="static-linux-binary"></a>

Every [release](https://github.com/lolepezy/rpki-prover/releases) includes a statically linked Linux x64 executable. Just download and run it.

## Docker image <a name="docker-image"></a>

You can run `rpki-prover` using Docker:

```
docker run lolepezy/rpki-prover:latest
```

The image is available on Docker Hub.

Since `rpki-prover` requires a persistent directory for TALs, caches, temporary files, etc., a persistent volume must be configured. A typical sequence of commands looks like this:

```
docker volume create rpki-data
docker pull lolepezy/rpki-prover:latest
docker run -p 9999:9999 --mount source=rpki-data,target=/rpki-data lolepezy/rpki-prover:latest
```

The key part is `target=/rpki-data`, which is created by default inside the Docker container. Alternatively:

```
docker run -p 9999:9999 --mount source=rpki-data,target=/something-else lolepezy/rpki-prover:latest --rpki-root-directory /something-else
```

## Building from source <a name="building-from-source"></a>

The software is a daemon written in Haskell and can be built using [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

The instructions below are for Linux but apply equally to \\\*BSD and macOS. Windows is not supported or tested.

* Install prerequisites: `lmdb`, `lzma`, `expat`, `gmp`, and `rsync`.

  * On Linux:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install rsync libz-dev libexpat1-dev liblmdb-dev liblzma-dev libgmp-dev
    ```
  * On macOS:

    ```
    brew install rsync lmdb xz expat
    ```
  * For other Unix-like OSes, use the appropriate package manager.

* Install `stack` as described [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)

* Clone the repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/lolepezy/rpki-prover/
  ```

* Run `./build-local.sh` inside the `rpki-prover` directory. This takes 30-50 minutes as it builds required libraries.

* After building, run `rpki-prover` from `~/.local/bin` as described in the usage section.

It prints logs to stdout. Once you see:

```
Validated all TAs, took ...
```

(which may take several minutes), you can fetch VRPs:

```
curl -s http://localhost:9999/api/vrps.csv
curl -s http://localhost:9999/api/vrps.json
```

# RTR server <a name="rtr-server"></a>

RPKI Prover can be an [RTR server](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8210), to enable the feature, add `--with-rtr` CLI option. It may also make sense to add `--rtr-address` and `--rtr-port` to listen on.

# HTTP API <a name="http-api"></a>

Visit [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) to view the UI reporting metrics, trust anchors, repositories, and any errors or warnings.

There are multiple API endpoints. The easiest way to explore them is via the `/swagger-ui` URL using Swagger UI.

## Prometheus metrics <a name="prometheus-metrics"></a>

Prometheus metrics are available at the standard `/metrics` path.

# Support for RSC <a name="support-for-rsc"></a>

RPKI Prover supports validating RPKI Signed Checklists ([RSC draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc/)).

To validate files using an RSC object, you need a running `rpki-prover` instance (same version) to use its cache of validated objects. In the examples below, it is assumed that the instance is running with `--rpki-root-directory /var/prover`. You may omit this option to use the default (`~/.rpki`).

To validate `foo.txt` and `bar.bin` against `checklist.sig`:

```
rpki-prover --rpki-root-directory /var/prover --verify-signature --signature-file checklist.sig --verify-files foo.txt bar.bin
```

To validate all files in a directory:

```
rpki-prover --rpki-root-directory /var/prover --verify-signature --signature-file checklist.sig --verify-directory ./dir
```

# Resource consumption <a name="resource-consumption"></a>

A cold start (no cache) takes at least a few minutes and consumes 3-5 minutes of CPU time. This can be slightly reduced by increasing `--cpu-count` if multiple CPUs are available. CPU-bound tasks scale well up to 8–10 cores, but overall warm-up time is often limited by the slowest RPKI repository. After warm-up, the application is not very CPU-intensive. 

Current memory usage for 7 trust anchors (including [AS0 TA](https://www.apnic.net/community/security/resource-certification/tal-archive/) and [AS0 of LACNIC](https://www.lacnic.net/4984/2/lacnic/rpki-rpki-trust-anchor)) with around 800K VRPs is under 3GB total. Adding or removing TAs affects this.

Memory reporting in tools like `top/htop` can be misleading. For example:

```
VIRT   RES    SHR
1.0T   4463M  3920M
```

Here, `SHR` is mostly LMDB cache and mmap-ed files. So actual heap usage is around `4463 - 3920 = 543M`.

Memory consumption is determined more by the size of the largest objects than by their count. 3GB RAM is recommended to reduce IOPS during validation. Each validation goes through over 400K objects, \~3KB each, so several hundred MB in FS page cache is beneficial.

Disk usage depends on `--cache-lifetime-hours`. The default of 24 hours results in a \~4GB cache. Periodic compaction requires an extra 30–40% of disk space. Around 2GB may also be needed for `rsync` mirrors. A total of 10GB is recommended.

# Known issues <a name="known-issues"></a>

* As noted, total RSS can reach several GB, mostly mapped to the LMDB cache. However, `rpki-prover` may be killed by the OOM killer unless properly configured.

# Why Haskell? <a name="why-haskell"></a>

* Compact codebase (\~17KLOC), including custom CMS parsing
* Fast prototyping and smooth refactoring
* Quick iteration and short time-to-market
* High-level language with good performance (GC, immutability, powerful type system)
* Initially chosen "because it's cool"—the rest followed
